# ONE-NAS: Online NeuroEvolution-based Neural Architecture Search

ONE-NAS (Online NeuroEvolution-based Neural Architecture Search) is the first evolutionary algorithm capable of designing and training RNNs in real-time as data arrives in an online fashion. Unlike traditional time series forecasting methods that require offline pre-training, ONE-NAS continuously evolves both the structure and weights of Recurrent Neural Networks in response to streaming data. The algorithm utilizes island-based evolutionary strategies with repopulation techniques to maintain diversity and prevent catastrophic forgetting, while training new genomes on subsets of historical data to handle data drift effectively.

Implemented in C++ and built on the same foundation as EXAMM, ONE-NAS is designed for distributed computation and offers excellent scalability from personal laptops to high-performance computing clusters. The system employs a distributed architecture where worker processes handle RNN training while a main process manages population evolution and orchestrates the overall evolutionary process. ONE-NAS has been evaluated on real-world datasets including wind turbine sensor data and financial time series, demonstrating superior performance compared to classical TSF methods, online LSTM/GRU networks, and online ARIMA approaches.

# Getting Started and Prerequisites

ONENAS has been developed to compile using CMake. To use the MPI version, a version of MPI (such as OpenMPI) should be installed.

## OSX Setup
```bash
brew install cmake
brew install mysql
brew install open-mpi
brew install libtiff
brew install libpng
brew install clang-format
xcode-select --install
```

## RIT Cluster Setup
```bash
# GCC (9.3)
spack load gcc/lhqcen5

# CMake
spack load cmake/pbddesj

# OpenMPI
spack load openmpi/xcunp5q

# libtiff
spack load libtiff/gnxev37
```

## Building
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Running ONENAS

ONENAS can be run in two different modes - MPI (distributed) or multithreaded. For quick start with example datasets using default settings:

## MPI Version
```bash
# In the root directory:
sh scripts/one-nas/coal_mpi.sh
```
